# Mapping Earthquakes

### Technology

This project was developed using JavaScript to develope the maps and the overlays to display the earthquakes.  The earthquake data was pulled from using d3.json files from the website.  

### Project

The purpose of this project is to overlay earthquake data and visualize it for the average person.  While visualizing this data I did not realize how many earthquakes happen each week.  The different styles and map backgrounds give this data an added visual appeal.  Overall, I enjoyed this challege because of the different way to visualize the data through a HTML file.
